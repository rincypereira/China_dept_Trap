# China_dept_Trap

The Chinese debt trap refers to a situation where countries borrow significant amounts of money from China and are unable to repay the debt, resulting in China exerting political or economic pressure on these countries to achieve its strategic objectives.

To analyze this phenomenon, a dataset was imported from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/chinese-debt-trap![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66639543/224611458-f46232f7-b8d7-4297-8b82-0bb72c9ad937.png) containing information on the amount, lender, borrower, sector, and country of Chinese investments. The dataset had 858 rows and 8 columns, which were explored to find any null values and replaced with mean values.

Visualizations were created to identify insights such as the highest investment made in 2016, where the greatest lender was EXIMBank, and the transportation sector received the largest amount of investment. Data wrangling was performed to standardize the amounts which were denoted in millions and billions.

The dataset was then used to identify the top 25 countries where significant Chinese investments were made and the top 25 countries that borrowed money from China.

Pakistan was analyzed in-depth to identify year-wise and sector-wise investments made by China in Pakistan. By analyzing this data, we can gain a better understanding of the Chinese debt trap and its impact on countries.
